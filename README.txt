A c file "student_id_generate.c" to generate unique keys for each student.

Part 1:
    In part 1, all the functions required for AVL tree and the "chained_hash" query functions are implemented. 
    I have inserted the keys in student_id.txt. The "search" and "delete" can be used as well for searching a student or deleting it.

Part 2: 
    In part 2, I made two hash tables, of sizes SIZE1 and SIZE2 respectively. Insert, search and delete functions are implemented
    independently for both the tables. Printed the total number of probes for all the operations mentioned.
